      <h1> Covid-19 </h1>
      <h2 class = "h2-title"> What is Covid-19? </h2>
      <p class = "pTag5">
        COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease) is an infectious disease that is caused by a recently discovered coronavirus, the novel Sars-Cov2. Those infected with COVID-19 typically experience mild to moderate respiratory illness (see below for a more extensive list of symptoms) and are able to recover without intensive medical assistance; however, the risk of developing more serious symptoms still persists and is especially high amongst those with underlying medical conditions. More specifically, individuals with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are the most likely to experience exacerbated symptoms such as difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, and/or loss of speech or movement. 
      </p>
      <h2 class = "h2-title"> The origin of Covid-19 </h2>
      <p class = "pTag5">
        Although the origins of COVID-19 are still largely unknown, scientists believe that the virus is of zoonotic origin, from bats or a similar animal. On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization was informed of several cases of pneumonia with no identifiable cause emerging in Wuhan City, China. The following year, on January 7, Chinese authorities deemed the cause of the seemingly mysterious pneumonia a novel coronavirus, temporarily named 2019-nCoV (now referred to as Sars-Cov2.) 
      </p>
      <h2 class = "h2-title"> Signs and Symptoms of Covid-19 </h2>
      <p class = "pTag5">
        Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, and tiredness, as well as some less common symptoms such as aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhea, headache, conjunctivitis, loss of taste or smell, and rashes or discoloration of skin. Those exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 are advised to self-isolate for a period of 14 days to avoid spreading the disease to others around them. On average, it takes roughly 5 or 6 days after infection for symptoms to appear, but it can take up to 14 days in some cases.
      </p>
      <h2 class = "h2-title"> How can you get Covid-19? </h2>
      <p class = "pTag5">
        Like many other viruses, COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets of saliva that are released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. As such, limiting in-person social interactions and practicing respiratory etiquette is integral in the event of an outbreak. 
      </p>
      <h2 class = "h2-title"> How can Covid-19 be treated? </h2>
      <p class = "pTag5">
        Treatment options for COVID-19 are relatively limited due to there not having been a cure discovered for the disease. Instead, the best way to prevent and slow down transmission of the virus is to adhere to safety guidelines prescribed by healthcare professionals and to take necessary precautions, such as washing your hands frequently and avoiding touching your face. Other ways of preventing infection include maintaining at least 1 metre of social distance between you and those who could potentially be infected, practicing physical distancing, staying home when possible and refraining from unnecessary travel, and avoiding large gatherings. mRNA vaccines that elicit an immune response in the body are another safe and effective way to reduce your chances of developing severe symptoms and being hospitalized as a result of infection. As well, these vaccines can help reduce the risk of transmission when in contact with others, allowing us to socialize with fewer restrictions.
