      <h2 class = "h2-title2"> What is Opatient? </h2>
      <p class = "pTag6">
        Opatient is a social enterprise focused on increasing access to telemedicine. Telemedicine is a faster, less expensive way to provide people with healthcare, and it has exploded during the pandemic. However, telemedicine can still be difficult to navigate. Digital healthcare has allowed for quick, easy access, but patients are also increasingly less likely to have a long-term family physician. So, Opatient stepped in to help.
      </p>
      <p class = "pTag6">
        We offer educational articles on a variety of medical conditions and topics, explaining everything from the origin to the symptoms. Then, the top medical centers and services for the condition or topic are attached to the bottom of the article. As such, people can understand their conditions and where they need to go on the internet to get treated. This is all free to patients. However, we are still able to earn money from companies, and this will go to eliminating medical debt.
