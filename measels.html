      <h1> Measles </h1>
      <h2 class = "h2-title"> What is Measles </h2>
      <p class = "pTag5">
        Measles is a severe, highly infectious disease caused by the rubeola virus. The rubeola virus is spread through air and is transmissible enough that up to 9 in 10 people around patients can be infected if they are not protected. It can cause severe complications, especially in children under the age of 5. For instance, 1 in 5 measles patients are hospitalized, 1 in 1,000 experience brain swelling, and 1-3 out of 1,000 die. As such, measles is a dangerous illness that must be taken seriously by patients.
      </p>
      <h2 class = "h2-title"> The origin of Measles </h2>
      <p class = "pTag5">
        The precise origins of the rubeola virus is unknown, the first records were produced by a Persian physician in the 9th century. In 1912, the US designated measles as a nationally notifiable disease, requiring providers and organizations to report all diagnosed cases. In this pre-vaccination era, the majority of children would contract measles at some point. This would lead to 3-4 million infections and 400-500 deaths every year.
      </p>
      <h2 class = "h2-title"> Signs and Symptoms of Measles </h2>
      <p class = "pTag5">
        It can take up to 4 days before symptoms appear. Common measles symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, and a rash. Typically, tiny white spots known as Koplik often appear 2-3 days after the first symptoms, and the rash develops 3-5 days after early symptoms. The rash usually presents after small red bumps that may converge with time.
      </p>
      <h2 class = "h2-title"> How can Measles be treated? </h2>
      <p class = "pTag5">
        For prevention, MMR vaccine provides long-term protection. The first dose should be administered at 12-15 months of age and the second dose at 4-6 years of age. While measles is uncommon in the US, people can still contract measles in other parts of the world. So, it is important to be careful when traveling internationally.
